The converter GUI should be compiled to jar file, e.g. core.jar. The jar
file assumes a folder at the same level named: 'converters'. Within this
folder the different converters should be placed.

Example: 'a18'
c:/tmp/core.jar
c:/tmp/converters/a18/AudioBatchConverter.exe
                           ...
