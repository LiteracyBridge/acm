# Windows Installer

Make a Windows Installer using [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)

## Steps
* Install _Inno Setup_ from the link above.
* Download _Java 8 jre_. We use zulu jdk 8, from Azul Java 8 JDK [64-bit](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-8-lts&os=windows&architecture=x86-64-bit&package=jdk) or [32-bit](https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu8.54.0.21-ca-jdk8.0.292-win_i686.zip)
  * I believe the 32-bit version will work correctly. If so, we can run on ancient Windows computers.
    * That's not necessarily doing our users any favors. An ancient Windows computer will be slow, and may not have sufficient memory to load, for example, a large program specification.
    * An alternative would be to produce both a 32-bit and a 64-bit installer. Since the online updater doesn't update the JRE, and since there is only one set of Java .jar files, the only downside is making users pick which one to install.
  * Download the zip file, and unzip it. Inside the unzipped content, find the `jre` directory.
  * Copy that `jre` tree as the `./jre` directory.
* Install the signing certificate, `code_signing.pfx`
  * See _Setting up the signing tool_, below.
  * Configure _Inno Setup_ to use the code signing certificate.
* Build `S3Sync` in the S3Sync project.
* Build `ACM` in the ACM project.
* Run the `build_dist.sh` script to copy files into the ACM directory. This is the source directory for the setup compiler.
 * Make sure `converters` contains the AudioBatchConverter.exe and FFmpeg tools.
 * The bat files for running the ACM and TB-Loader are in `./bats`.
 * The runtime icons are in `./images`.
 * The directory `./sync.config` contains common synchronizer configuration files, for uploading stats and user feedback, and for downloading software updates.
* Run `build_inst.sh` script to run the setup compiler.
* Run `build_s3.sh` script to copy files to S3.
* Alternatively, use **`build_and_deploy.sh`** to run all three scripts.

# Signing with the Extended Validation certificate
Greetings from Sectigo Support!

Please make sure that you have installed the Safenet Authentication Client s/w 10.8R2 (SAC_10_8_R2_Windows 5/26/2021) and Windows SDK on the computer, so that you can directly plug in the device for signing the applications.

* SafeNet Download for Sectigo EV Codesigning: https://sectigo.com/knowledge-base/detail/SafeNet-Download-for-Certificates-using-an-eToken-Smartcard/kA03l000000o6kL
* Windows 10 SDK :
https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/

* You must have finished the SafeNet setup process.
* You must be using a Windows computer.
* You must have installed Windows Development Kit.

If you've 'checked' all three of them, you're good to go. Here are the steps involved in the Code Signing process:

1. First, plug in your token in your computer
1. Open SafeNet Client
1. Now open the Command Prompt of your computer.
1. Copy and Paste the following command:
```
signtool sign /tr http://timestamp.sectigo.com /td sha256 /fd sha256 /a "Insert_path_to_the_file_you_wish_to_sign "
```
5. Once the command is entered, SafeNet will ask for your password, enter it.
1. Once you enter your password, your application should get signed.

# Setting up the signing tool:
First download the SignTool.exe, from one of the Windows developer kits (it may change from time to time; search for "signtool").
I got it from here: [Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/)

The _Inno Setup_ application must be configured to run the signing tool.

The `Tools->Configure Sign Tools...` menu option opens a difficult dialog box. 
You need to wind up with this result:
    `signtool="C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.19041.0\x64\signtool.exe" sign /a /f c:\users\bill\cert\code_signing.pfx /p HighlySecurePassword2 $pfx`
    
In the dialog, click `Add...`. You'll be prompted for "name of the tool". Enter the path,
click next. Then you'll get "Command of the Sign Tool:". Enter
    `sign /a /f c:\users\bill\cert\code_signing.pfx /p HighlySecurePassword2`
adjusting for the path to the certificate and the password.

# Fix Java 8 so it is legible on HighDPI devices 

The procedure below actually sets a registry key, so the value doesn't follow the program. It is _NOT_ a property of the program, Windows' misleading dialog to the contrary.

The procedure below sets this registry key:
* Key: `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Layers`
* Name: `{app}\ACM\jre\bin\java.exe`    _<-- full path to executable_
* Value: (STRING_SZ) `"~ DPIUNAWARE"`

Here's the inno setup incantation:
* `[Registry]
Root: HKCU; Subkey: "SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Layers"; ValueType: string; ValueName: "{app}\ACM\jre\bin\java.exe"; ValueData: "~ DPIUNAWARE"; Flags: uninsdeletevalue`

### How do I run Java apps upscaled on a high-DPI display?

Just found an easy solution on my Windows 10 machine:

* Find java.exe you installed. (in Windows Explorer.)
* Right click the java.exe, and choose -> Properties
* Go to Compatibility tab
* Click "Change high DPI settings"
* Check "[x] Override high DPI scaling behavior."
* Choose "System" for "Scaling performed by:"
